# Exam-Scheduler

Program to schedule final exams for a school registrar so that no student has two exams at the same time. 

The program uses greedy algorithm to determine an assignment of classes to exam slots such that: 
  * No student is enrolled in two courses assigned to the same exam slot. 
  * Any attempt to combine two exam slots into one slot would violate rule 1. 
  
The data structures used in this lab are:
  * Undirected graph lists
  * Vectors
  * Ordered lists
